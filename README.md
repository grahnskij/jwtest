## JWDEMO

This project is a simulated steering interface for a robot. Run the application and guide the robot around a room! 

## Frameworks

Frameworks used for this project is [Vue.js] (https://vuejs.org/) and [Jasmine 2.0] (https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) for testing. 

## Installation
 
No installation required. Open index.html in your browser and the application should be good to go from there. The application has been tested in most recent versions of Chrome and Firefox. Correct behavior not guaranteed in other browsers. 


## Tests

Tests are done with the jasmine test suite and can be found in the folder named "test". Just open the file named "SpecRunner.html" and the tests will run in your browser. The "lib" folder contains all the test framework files and "src" contains the unit tests file. The tests are written with the intent of testing each individual function to confirm the intended behaviour. One variable is also tested due to the outmost importance of it having the correct values at run time.
